PROJECT TITLE:
Ilir Subashi Economist Management System

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Our team met with the management team of Ilir Subashi Metal Supplier small company in Vore. 
The thorough need analysis which was performed by our team revealed that the company continuously faced 
difficulties managing its inventory and financial transactions by manual record keeping.
As the company has grown in the number of transactions and inventory, the issues with manual record 
keeping have continued increasing. Thus, the need for a centralized inventory economist management 
system has become crucial in order for the company to minimize these inefficiencies in their inventory 
management of the product list. Thus, this centralized inventory economist management system will be
able to manage the administrative tasks, inventory tasks, and economist tasks effectively and efficiently.


SOLUTION PROPOSAL:
The Ilir Subashi Management System will offer the solution of a user-friendly 
designed interface through which economists, administrators, and workers can
successfully achieve an efficient performance for each of their respective, 
required tasks within the company, no longer through manual record keeping, 
and as a result continuously updated information simultaneously so there are no 
inefficiencies and a real-time update of product inventory.

Features and Technologies:
Interface That's Easy to Use:
-User-friendly design that makes it simple to navigate and operate, guaranteeing rapid user adoption.
Centralized dashboard
-A unified dashboard with rapid access to pertinent capabilities and individualized overviews
for workers, economists, and administrators.
Access Control Based on Roles (RBAC):
-Distinct user roles for workers, economists, and administrators to guarantee safe access
and features tailored to their respective tasks.
Inventory Management Done Automatically:
-Reduced human error and offered a real-time updating of the product inventory 
through streamlined procedures for adding, removing, and searching goods.
Automating Financial Transactions:
-Automated financial transaction recording that guarantees accuracy and 
makes it easier to observe financial activity in real time.
Generation of Receipts:
-Productive generation of receipts, accurately recording key information
including the product ID, name, quantity, cost, total, and balance. The 
technology makes processing payments or printing simple.
Analytics & Reporting:
-Reporting capabilities that enable data-driven decision-making by
allowing economists to examine financial performance and inventory patterns.
Architecture that is Scalable:
-A system that can be expanded to accommodate the company's future
needs in terms of features, users, and goods.

Technologies:
Backend and Frontend:
We plan to use the NetBeans program with Java Programming Language. On the backend 
side, we create files, the connection to the database and develop the features.
Whilst on frontend, NetBeans offers a pallet of elements from textboxes, buttons, 
labels, dates etc, that are to be used with formatting the register files, login,
dashboard and adding color to them.
Database:
For the database of the project we use MySql from Xampp. The tables of admin, 
employee, product etc, are connected to the forms from the application.

PROJECT SCOPE:
The Ilir Subashi Management system is a software solution for the challenges that the 
business faces in manual inventory management and offers a more efficient and centralized 
operation. We aim to create a user-friendly interface for administrators, economists
and workers, and subsequently enhance their performance and efficiency.

1. CHOSEN DEVELOPMENT MODEL 
State the chosen development model, such as Agile, Waterfall, or Scrum. Justification: Briefly explain the rationale behind selecting this model. 
-Our chosen development model for this project is the Waterfall model. The Waterfall development model has been selected for the development of the Ilir Subashi Economist Management System. 
-First of all, this model provides a sequential approach to software development of the project, ideal as each phase of the project will be completed before going towards the next. The nature of our project aligns perfectly with this methodology, providing us with systematic progression from the gathering of requirements from user to the final implementation of the project. 
-Waterfall offers predictability and stability in project planning and execution. By
defining requirements upfront and following a linear progression through development phases, stakeholders can have a clear understanding of project timelines, costs, and deliverables. 
-The Waterfall method divides the project into well-defined, distinct phases, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. This clarity within all of the project phases will ensure the clear definition of each stage, the specific required objectives and deliverables, leading towards better control and management of our project. 
-Waterfall also minimizes changes to requirements once the project has started, as each phase is completed sequentially. Since in this project we expect the requirements to remain stable throughout the development lifecycle, this model is advantageous and suitable. In our case, the requirements are unlikely to change significantly and are well-understood. In the case of our project Ilir Subashi Economist Management System, we have thoroughly analyzed the scope and requirements during Phase 1, thus Waterfall provides a suitable framework for development.
